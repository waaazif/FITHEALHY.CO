                    Although the origins of yoga aren't founded in fitness, certain forms have been transformed into exercises 
                    that emphasise the physical aspects of the practise. Furthermore, Yoga is classified as exercise since it 
                    raises our heart rate for a sustained length of time, which is advantageous to general fitness. Yoga is 
                    definitely not in the same category of aerobic exercise as jogging or biking, but the amount of cardio 
                    benefit a person may gain from yoga depends a lot on the kind and tempo of the yoga you're performing. Aside from that, yoga is definitely not in the same category of aerobic exercise as running or biking, 
                    although the amount of cardio benefit a person can gain from yoga varies a lot on the style and tempo.

                    Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular fitness. Aerobic technically means "with oxygen," which indicates
                    that breathing regulates the quantity of oxygen that can reach the muscles to help them burn fuel and move.
                    Besides that, Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that causes you to sweat, breathe more deeply, and causes your 
                    heart to beat quicker than it would at rest. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides that, by doing Aerobic, it is also can strengthens your heart and lungs and training your cardiovascular
                    system to regulate and supply oxygen throughout your body more quickly and effectively. Aerobic exercise works 
                    your big muscle groups, is rhythmic, and may be done continuously for at least 10 minutes. Walking, running, indoor
                    cycling, and aerobic dance are all types of aerobic exercise that strengthen the heart and lungs, boosting your 
                    body's oxygen use. Aim for a 30-minute workout (or three 10-minute workouts each day) three to five days a week at 
                    a low level for overall wellness. A moderate-intensity exercise is one that causes you to breathe more deeply and 
                    your heart to beat faster.
