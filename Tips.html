                        <h3>GET ENOUGH SLEEP</h3>
                        <div class="pra">
                         <p>To maintain health other than nutrition, as a human being it is necessary to take care of sleep time 
                            and get enough sleep so that body can rest properly and adequately. This is a predetermined bedtime
                            Newborns: 16 until 18 hours/day, Kindergarten children: 11 until 12 hours/day, School children: At least 
                            10 hours/day, Adolescents: 9 until 10 hours/day, Adults: 7 until 8 hours/day. If a person lacks sleep it 
                            will cause you to feel tired and it will disrupt daily routine.</p>

                        <div class="pra">
                         <p>Breakfast needs to be taken to provide energy to do daily work. This is because, it will lower the 
                            metabolic rate in the body as it has to work slower to store energy while waiting for you to top up 
                            energy through food. In addition, breakfast has a positive effect on a stress hormone called cortisol. 
                            Cortisol plays a role in helping the body use sugar and fat for energy sources as well as controlling stress.</p>

                            health that have declined or been affected. We need to consume more fruits and vegetables and reduce fat in
                            our diet to live a healthy daily life</p>

                         <p>To live a healthy life we are required to be active so that our body has movement but not to harm ourselves. 
                            We can do exercise according to our bodies ability and we should understand our body language and stop when tired.
                            In doing activities, we need to drink a lot of water because our body is hydrated when doing exercise.</p>
